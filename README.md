## UI/UX
### Strategy
### Organisational Goals
Every National Park in the USA is a jewel. As a nature enthusiast myself, I do not know the information for most of the National Parks. I would usually search for the information based on the name of the park and visit the place. However, I have come to the realisation that there are many parks in every state and I do not even know the name of them. It would be ideal if there is an application that provides information of the parks based on the states that user is visiting and provides information about the campgrounds, parking lots and convinience stores for the campers, nature enthusiasts, hikers and roadtrippers. 
### User Goals
The users of Adventure Awaits are mostly hikers, nature enthusiasts, roadtrippers and tourists. The aim of the users is to be able to find all the parks, campgrounds and  parking lots in a state. After the user has chosen the park to visit, they are also able to see the convineance store nearby as well.
